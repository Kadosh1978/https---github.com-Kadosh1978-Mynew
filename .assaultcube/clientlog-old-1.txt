Beware: This is a recent release designed to allow users of Debian/GNU Linux based distributions to play.
  Although it can run on normal 1.2.0.2 servers, it is not fully supported.
  Coopedit will not work. Some maps will not work. Maps edited here will not work on old clients.
  There are slight changes in physics, so don't use this client to play competitively.
  As this is based on the latest game development, you may notice other changes. Good game!
